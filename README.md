# ShLauncher
A Game Library application that is meant to mimic some of the powerful utilities of Unix, with some friendly abstraction and safety implemented in a lightweight application. This is still a WIP, and we do not encourage trying to run this for anything more than educational purposes at this time. Reach out if you'd like to contribute by submitting an issue, or emailing me suggestions at jacoblc@uci.edu

## Features
### Library Features
- Automatic library generation with platform sorting from a single root directory
- Searching for games by name
- Displaying games
- (In-progress) Autocomplete searching for games by path
- (In-progress) Set launch configurations with cores and BIOS files.
- Linking with Steam Library

This is a passion project, inspired by similar applications. Please support official releases, and do not engage in piracy. 
I will NEVER distribute anything aside from the tools needed to operate the launcher.
