# ShLauncher
A Game Library application that is meant to mimic some of the powerful utilities of Unix, with some friendly abstraction and safety implemented in a lightweight application.

## Features
### Library Features
- Automatic library generation with platform sorting from a single root directory
- Searching for games by name
- Displaying games
- (In-progress) Autocomplete searching for games by path
- (In-progress) Set launch configurations with cores and BIOS files.
- Linking with Steam Library

This is a passion project, inspired by similar applications. Please support official releases, and do not engage in piracy. 
I will NEVER distribute anything aside from the tools needed to operate the launcher.
